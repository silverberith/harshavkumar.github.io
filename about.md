<p>I am an aspiring deep learning researcher who enjoys connecting the dot: be it ideas from different disciplines, people from different teams, or applications from different industries. I have strong technical skills and an academic background in engineering, statistics, and machine learning.

<p>My passion lies in building machine learning and computer vision technologies that have impact on the "real world" and use them to solve business problems and communicating complex ideas to non-technical participant. I am able to jump verticals to deliver high-performing AI solutions.

<p>Currently, working at RMgX Technology LLP as a Machine Learning Engineer, creating and maintaining models, and onboarding new data sets.

<p>If you catch me outside of work, I'm an adventurous traveler - 18 cities and counting - and an avid lover of football!

<p>I also like meeting new people over a cup of coffee. Feel free to reach out at harshavk97@gmail.com or DM on Instagram @_harshav.</p>
